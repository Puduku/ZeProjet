# MAMA, HANS and FRITZ (THE KATZENJAMMER KIDS) #

1. Synopsis
-----------
1.a The original story - more or less... 
Follow and support the katzenjammer kids in their (cunning) tours...
Landscape:
- garden: place (directory position) where the katzenjammer kids cook up their tours
- creek: specific path within garden (regarding tour execution) 
- island: all gardens' place (main directory position)
  The island is not so huge. It is easy to find your way around - especially when moving from one
  garden to another.
  Hence, as long as your are also located in the island, all gardens of the island are simply
  referenced with RELATIVE paths.
  However, out of the island, it's quite "terra incognita"...
  So, all emplacements outside the island are referenced with ABSOLUTE paths...
Main characters:
- Mama: she's a naive lady, but she's nevertheless the real "boss"... (see 'mama.sh' script)
- Hans & Fritz: (the katzenjammer kids) are the stars of the series. These two rascals have all
  sorts of tours for the pranks (done to the whole family) they carry out in the gardens. (see
  'katzenjammer.esh' script extension and 'hans.sh' and 'fritz.sh' exclusive scripts)
- Lena: she is a nice little girl who often helps Hans and Fritz to get back at der Captain and der
  Inspector... (see 'lena.esh' script extension)
- Adolf (Rollo) : he is a hypocritical, boastful, and prankster boy who likes to put the blame on
  Hans and Fritz. But the latter have also learned to turn their cousin's malicious initiatives to
  their own advantage. (see 'adolf.esh' script extension)    
- Der Captain: likes to nap and play cards while drinking cider. However, he has to shuffle the
  mats when Mama threatens him with the rolling pin... (see der-captain.sh script)
- Der Inspector: is as lazy as the captain. However, he is quite good at collecting coconuts... 
  (see 'der-inspector.sh' exclusive scripts)
- Miss Ross (Miss Twiddle) : a skinny and surly old maid who tries to give a good education to her
  cherubs, Adolf and Lena. She hates Hans and Fritz (who give it back to her) but she also has
  her uses to ensure the smooth running of the house. (see 'miss-ross.sh' script)

1.b Island metaphor in actual projects.
An island is nothing but a hierarchy of basic directories (the gardens) and files. For instance: 
~/Projects/Montreal/
  ISLAND 
  LaFontaine/
    hans.sh
  Connaught/
    hans.sh
    fritz.sh
  Rosemont/
    Botanique/
      hans.sh
      fritz.sh 
      der-inspector 
    Japonais/
      fritz.sh 
      der-inspector.sh 
NB: In real story, the Katzenjammer Kids lived in several places around the world. It seems that they
finally established their home on Bongo Island. However, I do not believe they ever lived in Montreal...

And to extend the metaphor, a creek corresponds to a particular path within a garden ; the idea is to 
let the katzenjammer kids follow different creeks at the same time while playing a tour... 


2. Configuration guide 
----------------------
2.a Creating a new island ("Montreal" in this example) 
- Choose a position directory for the island - e.g ~/Projects/Montreal
  $ export MONTREAL=~/Projects/Montreal 
  (You can add the line above in your profile - for instance your .flintrc file)
- Create location (directory) :
  $ mkdir $MONTREAL
- Create 'ISLAND' beacon file (the content of the file does not matter) :
  $ echo 'Yep! Montreal is an island.' > $MONTREAL/ISLAND
Note: possible (totally equivalent) file names of island's beacon file are:
  'ISLAND', 'Island', 'island', '.ISLAND', '.Island', or '.island'.

2.b Creating a new garden (e.g "MontRoyal" in "Montreal" island)
- Create garden location (directory) within the island:
  $ cd $MONTREAL
  $ mkdir MontRoyal
  $ cd MontRoyal
- You may need to define some "katzenjammer" scripts:
  + If you need to compile some code in the garden, you can create "hans.sh" exclusive script from
    model :
    $ cp "$MAMA/hans.sh.mod" hans.sh
  + If you need to run tests in the garden, you can create "fritz.sh" exclusive script from model :
    $ cp "$MAMA/fritz.sh.mod" fritz.sh
  + If you want to maintain code's documentation comments (so-called "coconuts"), you can create
    "der-inspector.sh" exclusive script from model (based on "coco" tool) :
    $ cp "$MAMA/der-inspector.sh.mod" der-inspector.sh
  Then edit and adapt your exclusive script(s). The following command shows the environment (bash
  functions and variables) usable by these exclusive scripts:  
  $ mama.sh -i
  Finally, don't forget to set 'execution permission' of script file, like:
  $ chmod u+x hans.sh


3. User guide
-------------
To play a "tour", run the corresponding exclusive script of the garden. The script must be referenced
by its location. For instance, in 'Montreal' island of ยง 1.b, to execute Fritz's tour in 'Botanique'
garden :
- From $MONTREAL/Rosemont/Botanique/ directory, type ./fritz.sh
- From $MONTREAL/Rosemont/ directory, type ./Botanique/fritz.sh
- From $MONTREAL/ directory, type ./Rosemont/Botanique/fritz.sh
- etc.

Hints:
- Any katzenjammer script recognizes the -h (help display resquest) option.
- At any time, you can issue "miss-ross.sh" command to verify Mama's  installation ;
  if that command is not recognized, this means thatyour 'Mama' installation is not correct; please
  check README-INSTALL.TXT file (present in Mama's base).
