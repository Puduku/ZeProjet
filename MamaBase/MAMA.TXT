# MAMA, HANS and FRITZ (THE KATZENJAMMER KIDS) #
################################################

1. Synopsis
-----------
1.a The original story - more or less... 
Support the katzenjammer kids in their (cunning) plots...
Landscape:
- garden: place where the katzenjammer kids execute their tours (directory position)
- creek: specific path within garden (regarding plot execution) 
- island: all gardens' place (main directory position)
  The island is not so huge. It is easy to find your way around - especially when moving from one
  garden to another.
  Hence, all gardens of the island are simply located with RELATIVE paths.
  However, out of the island, it's quite "terra incognita"...
  So, all emplacements outside the island are located with ABSOLUTE paths...
Characters:
- Mama: she's a naive lady, but she's nevertheless the real "boss"...
- Hans & Fritz: (the katzenjammer kids) are the stars of the series. These two rascals have all
  sorts of tours for the pranks (done to the whole family) they carry out in the gardens.
- Lena: she is a nice little girl who often helps Hans and Fritz to get back at der Captain and der
  Inspector...
- Adolf (Rollo) : he is a hypocritical, boastful, and prankster boy who likes to put the blame on
  Hans and Fritz. But the latter have also learned to turn their cousin's malicious initiatives to
  their own advantage    
- Der Captain: likes to nap and play cards while drinking cider. However, he has to shuffle the
  mats when Mama threatens him with the rolling pin...
- Der Inspector: is as lazy as the captain. However, he is quite good at collecting coconuts...
- Miss Ross (Miss Twiddle) : a skinny and surly old maid who tries to give a good education to her
  cherubs, Adolf and Lena. She hates Hans and Fritz (who give it back to her) but she also has
  her uses to ensure the smooth running of the house.

1.b Island metaphor in projects.
An island is nothing but a hierarchy of basic directories (the gardens) and files. For instance: 
~/Projects/Montreal/
  ISLAND 
  LaFontaine/
    hans.sh
  Connaught/
    hans.sh
    fritz.sh
  Rosemont/
    Botanique/
      hans.sh
      fritz.sh 
      der-inspector 
    Japonais/
      fritz.sh 
      der-inspector.sh 

To extend the metaphor, a creek corresponds to a particular path within a garden ; the idea is to 
let follow different creeks at the same time while playing a tour... 

2. Configuration guide 
----------------------
2.a Creating a new island ("Montreal" in this example) 
Choose a position directory for the island - e.g ~/Projects/Montreal
$ export MONTREAL=~/Projects/Montreal 
(You can add the line above in your profile)
Create location (directory) :
$ mkdir $MONTREAL
Create 'ISLAND' beacon file (the content of the file does not matter) :
$ echo 'Bongo is the actual name of the island in the real story.' > $MONTREAL/ISLAND
Note: possible (totally equivalent) file names are:
  "ISLAND", "Island", "island", ".ISLAND", ".Island", or ".island".

2.b Creating a new garden (e.g "MontRoyal" in "Montreal" island)
Create garden location (directory) within the island:
$ cd $MONTREAL
$ mkdir MontRoyal
$ cd MontRoyal
You may need to define some "katzenjammer" scripts:
- If you need to compile some code in the garden, you can create "hans.sh" exclusive script from model :
  $ cp "$MAMA/hans.sh.mod" hans.sh
- If you need to run tests in the garden, you can create "fritz.sh" exclusive script from model :
  $ cp "$MAMA/fritz.sh.mod" fritz.sh
- If you want to maintain code's documentation comments (so-called "coconuts"), you can create
  "der-inspector.sh" exclusive script from model (based on "coco" tool) :
  $ cp "$MAMA/der-inspector.sh.mod" der-inspector.sh
Then edit and adapt your exclusive script(s). The following command shows the environment (bash
functions and variables) usable by these exclusive scripts:  
$ mama.sh -i
Finally, don't forget to set 'execution permission' of script file, like:
$ chmod u+x hans.sh


3. User guide
-------------
To play a "tour", run the corresponding exclusive script of the garden. The script must be referenced
by its location. For instance, in Montreal island of ยง 1.b, to execute Fritz's tour in Botanique garden :
- From $MONTREAL/Rosemont/Botanique/ directory, type ./fritz.sh
- From $MONTREAL/Rosemont/ directory, type ./Botanique/fritz.sh
- From $MONTREAL/ directory, type ./Rosemont/Botanique/fritz.sh
- etc.

Hints:
- Any katzenjammer script recognizes the -h (help display) option.
- At any time, you can issue "miss-ross.sh" command to verify 'Mama's  installation ;
  if that command is not recognized, then your 'Mama' installation is not correct; please check
  README-INSTALL.TXT file (present in Mama's base).
